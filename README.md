## Description: 
Sensus is a decentralized governance protocol for transparent administration .
Distribution :- Airdrop

( Further Distribution via Airdrop to increase community participation )

By deploying Sensus Protocol users can deploy Constituion X which enables smart contract based rules and guidelines which the users adhere too .Sensus uses Ballot Voting mechanism where users can vote on proposals and amendments .The anonymity is verified via Sensus Masternode network .
Which keeps every vote anonymous .Voting is 100% secure and immutable. Voter anonymity is maintained .

The sensus DRP network is built on top of the protocol , the DRP Network is a collection of SaaS plugins that assist blockchain platforms and applications .

Proposal Voting Mechanism
Proposal Voting Mechanism consists of three components: Proposals, Votes, and Budgets.
Anyone User can submit a proposal for a small fee on the Sensus Network
Shareholders can cast votes for or against proposals.
Approved proposals become budgets.
Budgets are paid directly from the blockchain
Reputation Management
Decentralized identity and reputation without doubt is one of the most anticipated features of blockchains. Countless projects are trying to address it from various angles, ranging from authentication to AML/KYC .

One of the best characteristics of our blockchain technology is its transparency. The crypto algorithms that we use on top of it are merely mathematics and can be safely audited by any external party .

Governing The Protocol
Applying and enforcing existing protocol rules is easy. Changing Sensusâ€™s protocol rules is much harder harder and requires a consensus among the community with more than 51% of the votes for or against the proposal . Incompatible changes to the Sensus protocol therefore require all users to apply the new rules at some agreed-upon point in time.
